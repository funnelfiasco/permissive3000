# Permissive 3000

**Note: this is an experimental license that has not been vetted for use in any
jurisdiction by competent legal professionals. Use at your own risk.**

This project is an attempt to write a permissive license using only the words
contained in the [Oxford 3000 Wordlist](http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/wordlist/english/oxford3000/).
This was inspired by a [post](http://projects.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss/2015-January/001626.html)
 on the [Open Source Initiative's](http://www.opensource.org) license-discuss
mailing list.

The original text is the [BSD 3-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
rewritten to only use words in the Oxford 3000 Wordlist (plus the word
"copyright"), for which an exception was made. All edits are intended to
preserve the intent of the original license.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. This license is under the CC0 1.0
Universal license (see CC0.txt for full terms) and all contributions are
accepted under the same terms (i.e. inbound = oubound).

## Experimental nature

As warned above, this is an experimental license designed to serve as an
opportunity to explore simple-language licensing. I do not advise anyone to use
this for a real project. The original author (translator? editor?) has no formal
legal training. Caveat licensor!

If, at some point, this license becomes suitable for use, numbered versions will
be released. Otherwise, consider this to be a permanent work in progress.
